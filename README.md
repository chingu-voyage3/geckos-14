# DashThings.io

DashThing.io is tool dedicated to DIYers in need of an easy way to build
**Dashboard** for their **Things**.

## Definition

We are using the concept of "Things" described in the "Building the Web of
Things" book writen by Dominique D. Guinard and Vlad M. Trifa:

_A Thing with an uppercase "T" refers to a smart thing. A physical object that's
digitally augmented with one or more of the following:_

* _Sensors (temperature, light, motion, and so on)_
* _Actuators (displays, sound, motors and so on)_
* _Computation (can run programs and logic)_
* _Communication interfaces (wired or wireless)_

We also assume that all connected Things follow the authors recommendations and
W3C definition of a Web Thing: http://model.webofthings.io/

## Features

* Connect a Thing and let our App discover all sensors and actuators.
* Display Data on a Dashboard. (Static, Polling or Real Time)
* Create Labs and Share your Things to the world.

## Tech Stack

We decide to use a MERN stack and D3 for this app for many reasons:

* All Team members wished to discover it and build a MERN app
* NodeJS, ReactJS, Express and MongoDB arepopular and well Documented
* D3 is powerful data Viz library using

For Tests and CI we will be using JEST and Travis

* Jest is available with the Create-react-app provided by Facebook
* Travis CI is used by the Chingu Organisation and is free for opensource
